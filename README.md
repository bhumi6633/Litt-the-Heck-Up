# Litt the Heck Up
> Get roasted. Get motivated. Get results.  
> *Inspired by Suits.*

###  End of Summer. Start of Something Bigger.
Summer’s almost over and school’s about to start.
So I thought why not build something fun before life gets hectic again?

I’ve always been *obsessed* with Suits (Harvey, Donna, Mike... all of it), so I made a Suits-inspired web app where the characters either motivate you or roast you into greatness.
If you're freaking out about being productive, let the Suits characters yell at you instead.

###  What It Does

1.  **Enter your goal**  
   e.g., "Wake up at 5AM", "Finish my resume", "Grind LeetCode"

2.  **Click 'Litt Me'**  
   Instantly get:
   -  A motivational quote  
   -  A roast to fire you up  
   -  A 3-step  power plan

3.  **Add another goal**
   Stack your motivation. Track your grind.

4.  **View past goals**
   See what you've committed to and what Suits character called you out for it.

###  Built With

- **React.js** + **Tailwind CSS**
-  `localStorage` to save your goal history
-  **Google Gemini Pro** for AI-generated quotes and plans
-  Hosted on Vercel

###  Why I Built This

Because goal-setting apps are boring.  
Because motivation doesn't need to be fluffy and most important of all : I love and live by Harvey's mindset.
